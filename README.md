console-tools
=============

small toys to let you do things in the R-console that are  bash-ish

November 2014: some of these, including splatnd, pushd, and popd, are included in the 'cgwtools' package.  This package is available in my "packages" repository,  and may or may not be available at CRAN, depending on whether they reject a function which modifies a  hidden object in the Global Environment (pushd and popd do this).
